# My web portfolio

Hey! I'm Abay, if you haven't already gathered that by now. I'm a software engineer from Astana, Kazakhstan. I specialize in the frontend, primarily React, but love exploring new tools and technologies right for the job.


Currently, I am working in the company taking projects to build mobile and web applications, honing my skills building various commercial products. I also take different online courses always eager to learn, while also studying at my university,👨🏻‍🎓 going deeper into best practices and familiarizing myself with new programming languages).

Outside of work, I play tennis with my friends and family, read some books📗 both code related and not, and watch TV shows to advance my English proficiency.

I'm actively looking for new positions where I can prove my passion for code. If you think you've got an opening that I can fill, let's connect 🔗
